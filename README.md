# Week-1

These are three mini projects I did. My first mini project, I wrote a function that could tell me whether a number was even or odd. My second mini-project, I wrote a program that would choose a random number from 1-100 and allow the user to guess higher or lower and would tell the user whether their guess was too high or too low. My third mini-project was writing a program that allowed the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors.
